Project Overview:
Objective: Develop a simple to-do list application using Python with an emphasis on 
functions and data structures.
Key Components:
1. Functions: You'll be implementing various functions to handle different aspects of the 
to-do list application. Functions are modular blocks of code that perform specific tasks, 
making your code more organized and easier to understand.
Function to add a task
Function to delete a task
Function to display the list of tasks
Function to mark a task as complete
2. Data Structures: Utilize appropriate data structures to store and manage the to-do list. 
A common choice would be a list or a dictionary, but you can explore other options based 
on your creativity and understanding.
